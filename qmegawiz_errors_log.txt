C:/intelFPGA_lite/17.0/avr_core/inst_mem.v

Feb 06 12AM:23:06>: The following design file, which has identical name but a different extension 
from the specified variation file, already exists in the working directory:

inst_mem.vhd

This may create a conflict of design files and/or lead to undesirable side
effects.

Is it OK to continue file generation?
